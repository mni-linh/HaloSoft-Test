# HaloSoft-Test

Hi everyone, I'm Linh. I'm 23 years old.

I graduated from Ho Chi Minh City University Education with a degree in Software Engineering of Infomation Technology.

I have 1 year of experience as Front-end Developer.

I have worked as a Front-end Developer at Hahalolo Travel Social Network Joint Stock Company.‚Äù

During my time at Hahalolo, I was responsible for Writing code to build a user interface and admin for products like hotel rental, car, air ticket, tours,...

My goal is to apply existing knowledge and learn more from everyone on the team to complete the company's work well, as well as improve and enhance skills to be able to confidently say that I'm a FE Dev

In my free time, I will climb a mountain if I have any time or I have less time I will go for a walk and listen to music

I like outdoor activities or activities associated with nature like planting trees.
